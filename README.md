## Hi there 👋


👋 Hi, I’m Michael — a lifelong learner and Data Analyst exploring the intersection of business, data, and technology.
Though my foundation is in Management and Accounting, I’ve developed a deep passion for Data Analytics, Data Science, and Engineering — and I’m committed to mastering them through continuous learning and hands-on projects.

I’m excited to connect with mentors, professors, and fellow learners who share a vision for solving real-world problems through data.

**awesome-hubdata/awesome-hubdata** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

  🔭 I’m currently working on:  
  Data analytics projects focused on sales performance, visualization, and pattern recognition using Python and Power BI.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:  
  Advanced **Data Science techniques** including **statistical modeling**, **machine learning**, and **data engineering workflows**.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:  
  Academic or applied research projects that explore data-driven solutions in **business, education, or sustainability**.

- 🤝 I’m looking for mentorship and guidance in:  
  **Graduate studies and research opportunities** in Data Science, with an interest in leveraging analytics for social and economic insights.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I see data as a language — the more I learn it, the better I understand how the world truly works.
